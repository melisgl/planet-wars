Common Lisp Starter Package v0.1 for Planet Wars

This file contains specific information about the Common Lisp (CL)
starter package for the [[http://ai-contest.com/][Planet Wars Google AI Challenge]].

Based on the [[http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=421][work]] of Erik Winkels (aerique@xs4all.nl). Refactored and
bloated rather mercilessly by Gabor Melis (mega@retes.hu).

* Usage

First, read the [[http://ai-contest.com/using_the_tools.php][Using the Tools]] page on the contest site. This
explains how to run to example bots against each other. The CL starter
package contains the same tools and example bots, so you can use the
same invocation to run an example:

  java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map7.txt 1000 1000 game.log \
      "java -jar example_bots/RandomBot.jar" \
      "java -jar example_bots/DualBot.jar" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar

Note that Java needs to be installed on your system.

The version of the tools is [[http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=534][a1k0n's v1.2]].

The script =bin/run-bot.sh= loads the planet-wars asdf system and
calls the function PW:PLAY. It can be passed as a player to
=PlayGame.jar=:

  java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map7.txt 1000 1000 game.log \
      "./bin/run-bot.sh" \
      "java -jar example_bots/DualBot.jar" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar

It may take a while to compile and may even time out. In this case
just retry (no need for compilation the second time) or compile the
bot by running =make= that should load the planet-wars system and save
the image as an executable named =MyBot=. The invocation to run the CL
bot is almost the same as the above but replaces the first bot with a
call to =MyBot=:

  java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map7.txt 1000 1000 game.log \
      "./MyBot" \
      "java -jar example_bots/DualBot.jar" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar

** Slime

To run SBCL as it will be on the server (with the maximum heap size
set and with ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY* initialized) do =C-u M-x slime=
in emacs and enter =sh /path/to/starter-kit/bin/run-sbcl.sh= at the
=Run lisp:= prompt.

Or with an recent SBCL with ASDF v2, you may simply do:

  (asdf:initialize-source-registry '(:source-registry
                                     (:tree "/path/to/starter-kit/")
                                      :ignore-inherited-configuration))

Before =(REQUIRE :PLANET-WARS)=.

** Submitting the bot

=make submission= creates a zip file that can be used to submit a bot
to the competition. Once submitted your code is compiled using a
Makefile not unlike the one that came with this package, so be sure to
test a compiled version of your bot before submitting.

At the time of this writing the memory available in the sandbox for
bots is not specified, =run-sbcl.sh= defaults to 768M for the heap.
*** TODO fix heap limit in executables
The SAVE-RUNTIME-OPTIONS parameter to SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE is only
available since SBCL 1.0.31 so the executables have no such limit.
Revisit this when the exact SBCL version on the server is known.
*** TODO automatically submit the zip file to the server with `curl`
** ProxyBot

To make working on your bot a little more natural / lispy I've
included a proxy bot. This bot does nothing in itself except connect
to another bot running at 127.0.0.1:41807 and pass game state and bot
orders back and forth to the game engine and the other bot.

This means you can keep your bot running in a permanent, in my case,
Emacs + Slime session while the proxy bot is the one that gets started
up and shut down every time. So you don't have to recompile your bot
every time in case it times out, but more importantly you don't lose
your bot's state when it crashes since you'll just drop into the
debugger and can inspect the situation.

However, there's a slight speed penalty because of the extra code and
communications.

In SBCL the server process to which the proxy bot connects can be
started with:

 =(pw:start-server-for-proxy-bot)=

On unithread builds this creates a single thread that accepts
connections calls PW:PLAY on the socket stream and when the game is
finished it accepts a new connection.

On multithreaded builds (#+SB-THREAD) it calls PW:PLAY in a new thread
so multiple proxy bots can play at the same time.

*** Running the ProxyBot

First, compile the proxy bot with =make ProxyBot=. Then - assuming
there is a real bot to connect to - it is as easy to use as running:

  java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map7.txt 1000 1000 game.log \
      "./ProxyBot" \
      "java -jar example_bots/DualBot.jar" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar

If that fails (proxy bot times out) check =proxy-bot.log=.
