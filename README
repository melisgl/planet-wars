This is a somewhat cleaned up version of bocsimacko-b0.83, my final
submission to the Google AI Planet Wars Challenge [1].

* To get a binary

1. install ACL or SBCL
2. do './configure --lisp acl' or './configure --lisp sbcl'
3. make

* Get an engine/viewer
You can run and view games with any two (even the official one), but
the best is this:

https://github.com/albertz/planet_wars-cpp

Clone it just next to this README so that scripts find its binaries.

It needs to be patched to compile with recent gcc:

diff --git a/BotCppStarterpack.cpp b/BotCppStarterpack.cpp
index 3a1e139..9b68edb 100644
--- a/BotCppStarterpack.cpp
+++ b/BotCppStarterpack.cpp
@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@
 #include <iostream>
+#include <unistd.h>
 #include "game.h"
 
 #ifdef GAMEDEBUG

* Play games

./bin/on-all-maps.sh <binary1> <binary2>

This will create two log files in games/<date> for each map. You can
view the games played:

./planet_wars-cpp/showgame < games/2014-05-17-08-06-48/map_finals-1_01.txt-1-vs-2.log
* To understand the code 

In src/ read model.lisp, player.lisp and maybe alpha-beta.lisp. The
rest is plumbing and small third party libs (alexandria,
parse-number).
